<h1>Tetris inspired game application</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/wz4dtsXkipA)

<h2>Description</h2>
Developed a fast-paced block placement game in Java inspired by Tetris. The project was managed using Maven, with Git for version control. Event-driven programming was used for the game logic, and logging was implemented as a standard practice for error detection. The game was built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java, and multiplayer was also developed.
